# SampleUnityProject
This is a suite of very simple minigames developed as a very broad example of my capabilites in building a Unity project in under 6 hours. Please excuse the programmer art.

Controls:
Controls vary based on the current active minigame.
Up-Arrow: move up/jump
Down-Arrow: move down/crouch
Left/Right-Arrows: move left/right
Spacebar: jump/shoot/make selection

Clicking on the top knob of the TV will switch minigames. Clicking and holding down on the bottom knob will adjust the visual effect applied to each separate game.
